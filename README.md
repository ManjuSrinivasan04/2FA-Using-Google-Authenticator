# 2FA-Using-Google-Authenticator

* Google Authenticator: This application allows us to integrate TOTP easily into our developments.
* Google Authenticator generates time-based OTPs which are calculated using the algorithm specified in RFC6238. 
* Time-based OTP (TOTP) is an algorithm that factors in the current time to generate a unique one-time password.

## It’s secure because:

* The password changes every n number of seconds (usually, 30 seconds), preventing eavesdroppers from using that same password later in the future if somehow they’re able to get hold of it.
* The password may be generated by an app on the user’s phone, making it more difficult for an attacker to acquire the password, as the user’s phone is usually by his/her side.

## It’s user-friendly because:

* In mobile app implementations, the user only needs to launch the TOTP application and then key-in the TOTP that appears on-screen into the application
* Unlike most mobile-based one-time passwords that need to be received via a text message or the Internet through some wireless connection, TOTPs aren’t dependent on the presence of a cellular signal or data connection.
